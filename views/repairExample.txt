How to insert a new repair request onto the mongo repair db

in the js file

router.post('<repair request route name>', async(req,res) => {
    const <variable name>  = new Repair({
        <fill will parameters passed from the ejs file or through some function 
        that gets the parameters or hard code the parameters>
        (Example would look like: 
            landlord: 'a_landlord', address: '123 Main Street', 
            apt: <find the requester's apt>, tenant: <probably can just put req.User.name>,
            issue: <parameter passed>, 
            image: <should check if parameter was passed, if so assign otherwise don't>,
            comments: <same as image>
        )
        <whatever the variable name is>.save();
        res.redirect('whereever you want to send them after its sent')
    })
})

in the ejs file

<form action='name of the repair route' method='POST'>
    <form data>
    <button type='submit'...>Submit</button>
</form>

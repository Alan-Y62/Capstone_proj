# Capstone Project - Daily Tenant

## Overview
### Ideas
Landlords trying to communicate with their tenants is slow and has no guarantee to reach everyone. 
Hassle for tenants to try to contact their landlords who may only be available at certain times.
Therefore, we created this website, which is a new way for landlords and tenants to interact with each other about home-related information.

### Goals
1. Successfully request and schedule a repair request. 
2. Successfully post an update that is viewable by all tenants and landlords. 
3. Send email notifications to the tenants whenever the landlords make an update.
